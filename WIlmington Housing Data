## Let's import  the functions we are going to work with including the TidyVerse and especially ggplot2. 
## I am also going to add some maps here

library(tidyverse)
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
## Make sure the working directory is the Capstone Folder

getwd()

## Let's read the csv we downloaded from Realtor.com

read.csv('RDC_Inventory_Core_Metrics_County_History_Pender_New_Hanover_Brunswick.csv')

## Now let's set it as the variable called Wilmington_data for ease of use

Wilmington_data <- read.csv('RDC_Inventory_Core_Metrics_County_History_Pender_New_Hanover_Brunswick.csv')

# We'll inspect the column names to see what we are working with here

colnames(Wilmington_data)
head(Wilmington_data)

## OK, so we've had a look at the data.  Let's try to pull some information from it
## We will use GGPLOT2 to see if the amount of time the housing spent 
## on the market increased or decreased over the last 5 years
## We will also rename some of the labels here
